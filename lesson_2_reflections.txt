What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You need to initialize a repository so an invisible .git file with meta data can be added to the desired directory and keep track of the directory history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a place to double check changes you've made and make sure you commit exactly what you want to.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can check the differences between the staging area and the working directory, or the most recent commit, and only commit logically similar changes at the same time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches help when you need multiple versions of the same project.
